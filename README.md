C64 Emulator
===========

The comodore 64 computer was one of the great home computers in the 1980's. This emulator is an attempt to recreate the old machine as accurately as possible.

I hope over time to create this software for the raspberry pi on bare metal in an effort to make the machine as native as possible without the actual hardware.

Installation
============

The current software expects SDL and so you will need to install the development libraries for it. Also because the ROM's for the commodore 64 and its variants are copyright. Unfortunately you will need to source them yourself and store them in a folder named roms next to the executable.

At the moment development has been on linux exclusively so I cannot give any guarantee's on your successes using this software on any other operating system.

Usage
=====

Starting the executable with the switch --debug in the console will show you its output as it runs.
